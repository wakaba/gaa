* Instructions for Git repositories

The |nightly| branch of the repository is used (force updated!).

Prepare |Makefile| in the root directory of the repository such that
|make updatenightly| does everything necessary, including but not
limited to:

  - |git submodule update --init|
  - Preparation of environment (e.g. installing modules)
  - Updating/building process
  - |git add|ing changed files

It does not (and should not) invoke |git commit| or |git push|.

A new copy of working tree for the repository is created for each
time.  The |make updatenightly| command should not modify the
environment outside of the repository.
