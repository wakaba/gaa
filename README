* Instructions for Git repositories

The |nightly| branch of the repository is used (force updated!).

Prepare |Makefile| in the root directory of the repository such that
|make deps| setups the environment (e.g. running |git submodule update
--init| and installing libralies and modules) and |make updatenightly|
does anything else necessary, including but not limited to:

  - Updating libraries or modules and data files
  - Building pre-compiled files
  - |git add|ing changed files

It does not (and should not) invoke |git commit| or |git push|.

The GAA clones the repositroy, then runs |make deps| and |make
updatenightly| in order.  A new copy of working tree for the
repository is created for each time.  The |make deps| and |make
updatenightly| commands should not modify the environment outside of
the repository's directory.

The |GAA| environment variable is set to a true value before |make
deps| and |make udpatenightly| commands are invoked.  Build/update
processes can consult with this variable to determine whether it is
invoked by GAA or not.
